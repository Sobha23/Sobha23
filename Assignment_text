After Voting pod deletion:
Voting pod deletion doesn't affect the result page as it takes data from the db pod to display.
Before the pod deletion the front end voting page was displayed for pod vote-94849dc97-5xx6c. But after the pod 
deletion its displayed for the newly created pod vote-94849dc97-9d8zw as shown in the snapshot.

DB pod creation:
After killing the pods in order, Observed once the pod is terminated a new pod is created for all three.
But for no pod restart count is one. When DB pod is deleted, RESULT and WORKER pod restart count becomes as 1 because these pods
are connected/dependent on DB , as DB is restarted so are these pods to be in sync.
All the data is deleted and worker and result pod got restarted as these two pods are connected to db pod
Once the db pod comes up, voting app works properly but old database entry is gone.
